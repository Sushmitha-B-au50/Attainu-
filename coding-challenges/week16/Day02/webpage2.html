    <h1 class="header"> Fruits! </h1>
    <h2 class="subheader"> Pineapple</h2>
    <p class="benefits"><b>In addition to large amounts of vitamin C and manganese, pineapples add to your daily value of vitamin B6, copper, thiamin, folate, potassium, magnesium, niacin, riboflavin, and iron.
        Pineapples are the only known food source of bromelain, a combination of enzymes that digest protein. That’s why pineapple works as a meat tenderizer: The bromelain breaks down the protein and softens the meat. 
        In your body, bromelain makes it easier for you to digest food and absorb it.</b>

    <h3 class="subheader1"> Mango</h3>
    <p class="benefits"><i>One of its most impressive nutrient facts is that just 1 cup (165 grams) of fresh mango provides nearly 67% of the DV for vitamin C. This water-soluble vitamin aids your immune system, helps your body absorb iron, and promotes cell growth and repair (1Trusted Source, 4Trusted Source, 5Trusted Source, 6Trusted Source).
        Mango is also a good source of the minerals copper and folate, which are especially important nutrients during pregnancy, as they support healthy fetal growth and development (7Trusted Source, 8Trusted Source, 9Trusted Source, 10Trusted Source).
        Mango is low in calories yet high in nutrients — particularly vitamin C, which aids immunity, iron absorption, and cell growth and repair.

    <h4 class="subheader2"> Orange</h4>
    <p class="benefits"><strong>Anti-inflammatory. Some foods tell your immune system it's under attack. This causes inflammation. When inflammation turns into a long-term problem, it can trigger diabetes, heart disease, arthritis, cancer, and Alzheimer's disease. Oranges have the opposite effect.
        Fiber. The 3 grams of fiber in a medium orange help keep your bowels healthy, your cholesterol and risk of heart disease low, and ulcers at bay. Fiber also slows the way your body absorbs sugar -- a big bonus if you have diabetes.
        Calcium. Oranges are high in this important nutrient, which keeps your bones, organs, and muscles strong.    </p>
    </strong>
    <h5 class="subheader3"> Apple</h5>
    <p class="benefits"><em>The same serving also provides 25% of the DV for vitamins E, B1, and B6.
        Vitamin E serves as a fat-soluble antioxidant, vitamin B1 — also known as thiamine — is needed for growth and development, and vitamin B6 is essential for protein metabolism (4Trusted Source, 5Trusted Source, 6Trusted Source).
        Apples are also a rich source of polyphenols, an important group of antioxidants. Antioxidants are compounds that protect your cells from free radicals — harmful molecules that contribute to the development of chronic conditions, like heart disease and cancer (4Trusted Source).
        While nutrition labels dont list these plant compounds, they are likely responsible for many of apples’ health benefits (1Trusted Source)
        To get the most out of apples, leave the skin on, as it contains half of the fiber and most of the polyphenols (7Trusted Source, 8Trusted Source).

    <h6 class="subheader4"> Papaya</h6>
    <p class="benefits"><mark>
        Papayas also contain healthy antioxidants known as carotenoids — particularly one type called lycopene.
       Whats more, your body absorbs these beneficial antioxidants better from papayas than other fruits and vegetables (3Trusted Source).
       The papaya is a tropical fruit high in vitamins C and A, as well as fiber and healthy plant compounds. It also contains an enzyme called papain, used to tenderize meat.

    <dt>Blueberries</dt>
    <dd>Blueberries are well known for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.
        In particular, theyare high in anthocyanin, a plant pigment and flavonoid that gives blueberries their characteristic blue-purple color. This compound helps fight cell-damaging free radicals that can lead to disease (8Trusted Source).</dd>
    <dt>Dragon fruit</dt>
    <dd>Also known as pitaya or pitahaya, dragon fruit is rich in many nutrients, including fiber, iron, magnesium, and vitamins C and E. It is also an excellent source of carotenoids, such as lycopene and beta carotene (26Trusted Source)</dd>
    <dt>Avocado</dt>
    <dd>
        Unlike most other fruits, avocados are high in healthy fats and low in natural sugars.</dd>
